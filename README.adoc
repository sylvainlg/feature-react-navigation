= feature-react-navigation - _Feature based navigation using react-navigation_


IMPORTANT: The v0.1.1 is only compatible with react-navigation v4

*feature-react-navigation* is a https://feature-u.js.org/[feature-u] module which provide a routing aspect into your features using https://reactnavigation.org/[react-navigation].

The module aim to build a single navigation tree with routes provided by each feature registred in your feature-u instance. Your features don't have the knowledge off the final tree, they only have to expose their routes throught the `route` aspect.

== Getting started

 $ yarn add feature-react-navigation

Additionnally, you may need peerDependencies installed :

[source,bash]
----
$ yarn add feature-u
$ yarn add @react-navigation/core
$ yarn add @react-navigation/native
or
$ yarn add @react-navigation/web
----

== Usage

=== 1 - Register the aspect

Within your mainline, register the feature-react-navigation `routeAspect` to feature-u's https://feature-u.js.org/cur/api.html#launchApp[launchApp()] method.

*Please note* that routeAspect has 2 required named parameters (see below for details) :

- <<createAppFunction configuration,`createAppFunction`>>
- <<navigationPattern configuration,`navigationPattern`>>

==== App.js

[source,js]
----
import { launchApp }          from 'feature-u';
import { createRouteAspect }  from 'feature-react-navigation';
import { createAppContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import features               from './feature';

// configure Aspects (as needed)
const routeAspect = createRouteAspect({
  createAppFunction: createAppContainer, // For react-native application
  navigationPattern: {...}
});

export default launchApp({

  aspects: [
    routeAspect,
    ... other Aspects here
  ],

  features,

  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) {
      AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => () => rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component
    },
});
----

==== createAppFunction configuration

Since v4, `react-navigation` is available on both react-native and react (web) platforms. The bootstrap for each platform differ a bit :

- react-native : https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html
- react web : https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/web-support.html

You can choose the method you like to create your application by passing the initilization method as a named parameter `createAppFunction`.

[source,javascript]
----
// For react-native application
import { createAppContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
createRouteAspect({
  createAppFunction: createAppContainer,
  ...
})

// For react web application
import { createBrowserApp } from '@react-navigation/web';
createRouteAspect({
  createAppFunction: createBrowserApp,
  ...
})
----

With this configuration, the module stay a pure `react` module. Any adherence with `react-native` is no longer required.

==== navigationPattern configuration

In mobile application, the navigation stack could be a lot more complex than on the web and `react-navigation` respond to that complexity by providing some different navigators (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html[stack], https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/switch-navigator.html[switch], https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/bottom-tab-navigator.html[tab], https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/drawer-navigator.html[drawer]). The `navigationPattern` configuration is the way to deal with it in `feature-react-navigation`.

Beside, features don't have to know how the navigation is organize in the final application. Even, you may want to re-use some feature across applications whithout inheriting the same navigation stack. With this way of building navigation stack, your application have total control about it.

- `navigator`: create[Navigator] function
- `navigationOptions`: options taken by the navigator function
- `routes`: list of named route from features
- `featureRoutes`: list of feature names, expended to each routes starting by the feature name - see <<Promote routes>>.

[source,javascript]
----
import createAnimatedSwitchNavigator from 'react-navigation-animated-switch';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';

const navigationPattern = {
  navigator: createAnimatedSwitchNavigator,
  routes: {
    startup: {
      navigator: createStackNavigator,
      navigationOptions: {
        initialRouteName: 'app.START',
      },
      routes: ['app.START'],
    },
    unauth: {
      navigator: createStackNavigator,
      navigationOptions: {
        initialRouteName: 'app-login.LOGIN',
      },
      featureRoutes: ['app-login', 'app-subscription'],
    },
    auth: {
      navigator: createStackNavigator,
      navigationOptions: {
        initialRouteName: 'app-home.HOME',
      },
      featureRoutes: ['app-home', 'app-profil', 'app-offers'],
    },
  },
};
----

### 2 - Promote routes

Within each feature that promotes UI Screens, simply register the feature's route through the `Feature.route` property _(using *feature-u*'s [`createFeature()`])_.

In the sample, `login` feature promotes somes routes in a `react-navigation` [compatible format](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html). It's *strongly encouraged* to prefix all route names by the feature name in order to use `<<featureRoutes>>` pattern configuration.

.src/feature/login/index.js
[source,javascript]
----
import React            from 'react';
import {createFeature}  from 'feature-u';

import fname            from './feature-name'
import {LoginScreen,
    LoginSuccessScreen} from './screens';

export default createFeature({

  name:  'login',

  route: {
    routes: {
      [`${fname}.LOGIN`]: {
        screen: LoginScreen,
      },
      [`${fname}.SUCCESS`]: {
        screen: LoginSuccessScreen,
      },
    },
  },

  ... snip snip
});
